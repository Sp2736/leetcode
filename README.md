# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.

For most problems, I’ve included two versions:
- **Common-man code**: straightforward, readable, and easy to understand.
- **Optimized code**: improved for better time and/or space complexity.

This repo is mainly for tracking my practice and progress.
